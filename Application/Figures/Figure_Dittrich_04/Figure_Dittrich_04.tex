				\caption{{\bf HAPO metabolomics:} Active metabolomic subnetworks associated with maternal BMI detected by the {\it BioNet} algorithm, with a correlation threshold of $|\rho|=0.4$. Metabolites were measured in fasting serum samples obtained at 28 weeks gestation. Nodes are sized proportional to the magnitude of the node scores; solid edges correspond to edge scores with $|\rho| \ge 0.4$.}
